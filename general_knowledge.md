## I - x86-64 CPUs architecture 

```
CPU ----- Memory
 |      / 
 |     /    
IO devices
```

- **CPU** puts an address in the **Address Bus** to get data from {**Memory** | **IO**} at that address. 
- Then {**CPU** | **Memory** | **IO**} put data in the **Data Bus**
- The **Control Bus** controls the orientation of the transfer.
